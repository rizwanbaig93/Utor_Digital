          <p class="ff-poppins">Money is often considered a taboo subject, and individuals may feel uncomfortable
            discussing their personal finances openly. This lack of transparency and social dialogue
            around money can lead to financial insecurities, uninformed decision-making, and a lack
            of financial empowerment. There was a need for a platform that would provide users with
            transparent information, enable comparisons with peers, and create a community that
            encourages open financial discussions. </p>
            <h2 class="ff-Acme">Solution</h2>
            <p class="ff-poppins" >UtoR collaborated with Frich to develop a platform that addresses the challenges related
                to personal finance discussions and empowers individuals to feel confident about their
                financial situations.</p>

          <p class="ff-poppins">Urban transportation in many cities often faces challenges such as congestion, limited
            public transportation options, and affordability issues. People struggle with commuting to
            their destinations efficiently and affordably, leading to frustration and inefficiencies in the
            transportation system. There was a need for a technology-driven solution that could
            optimize transportation routes, enhance accessibility, and streamline operations for a
            better overall commuting experience.</p>
